# Business-Insights-360


AtliQ Hardware, amidst rapid global growth, faced challenges with data management due to its reliance on Excel, limiting scalability and real-time insights. To address this, I developed Power BI dashboards tailored to their needs:

1 Finance: Profit & Loss, Net Sales, and Gross Margin insights.
2 Sales: Top products and customers analysis.
3 Marketing: Regional performance and profitability drivers.
4 Supply Chain: Inventory and forecast accuracy.
5 Executive: Strategic revenue and performance overview.
